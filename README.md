Welcome to the my repository, where i explored various data science and machine learning projects as part of the SwiftSolvers Virtual Internship. Below, you'll find descriptions of the five projects included in this repository.

## Projects

### 1. Iris Flower Classification
- Task: Classify different species of iris flowers based on their features.
- Approach: I used machine learning to train a model that can identify iris flowers with high accuracy.

### 2. Unemployment Analysis
- Task: Analyze unemployment data to understand trends and factors affecting joblessness.
- Approach: I performed data analysis and visualization to gain insights into unemployment patterns.

### 3. Car Price Prediction
- Task: Predict the prices of cars based on their characteristics.
- Approach: I build a machine learning model that can estimate car prices, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

### 4. Email Spam Detection
- Task: Develop a system that can identify spam emails and keep your inbox clean.
- Approach: We create a spam filter using machine learning to separate legitimate emails from spam.

### 5. Sales Prediction
- Task: Predict future sales for a retail business based on historical data.
- Approach: I used machine learning to make accurate sales predictions.
